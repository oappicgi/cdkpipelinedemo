# Demo Web Application using Go

Credit goes to Martin Ombura Jr for his sample Go WebApp [here](https://medium.com/google-cloud/building-a-go-web-app-from-scratch-to-deploying-on-google-cloud-part-1-building-a-simple-go-aee452a2e654)

## Build

```
go build main.go
```
## Run

```
go run main.go
```

By default, the application will be listening on port 8080 and simply open a web browser to `http://<server>/:8080`
